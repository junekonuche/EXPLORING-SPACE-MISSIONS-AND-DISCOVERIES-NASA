# 🚀 Exploring Space Missions and Discoveries: A Data-driven Story from NASA's Archives

## 🛰️ Project Overview

This project explores NASA’s rich archive of space missions, exoplanet discoveries, and celestial observations through a data-driven lens. With a focus on storytelling and analysis, the project showcases how historical and recent mission data can reveal patterns in launch frequency, technology trends, and astronomical findings.

By integrating tools from Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, we aim to bring insights to life and inspire curiosity about our universe.
